# Rust Genetic Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the **Rust Genetic Algorithm Playground**! 🎉 This repository is a collection of Rust-based projects designed to explore, experiment with, and showcase the power of genetic algorithms and procedural generation. Each project is modular, well-documented, and serves as a learning tool or a foundation for further development.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. **Procedural World Generator**

- **Description:** Generates a 2D terrain using Perlin noise.
- **Features:**
  - Procedurally generates a grayscale terrain map.
  - Saves the map as an image file for visualization.
  - Future plans: Add biomes, rivers, and dynamic chunk-based worlds.
- **Location:** [procedural\_world\_generator.rs](./procedural_world_generator.rs)

### 2. **Creature Generator** *(Coming Soon)*

- **Description:** Generates virtual creatures with random attributes (e.g., size, speed, energy).
- **Planned Features:**
  - Customizable attribute ranges.
  - Visualization of generated creatures.
  - Export creatures for use in simulations.

### 3. **Genetic Algorithm Engine** *(Coming Soon)*

- **Description:** A modular engine to simulate evolution and optimization using genetic algorithms.
- **Planned Features:**
  - Support for custom fitness functions.
  - Crossover, mutation, and selection methods.
  - Logging and visualization of evolutionary progress.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Rust (Install using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-genetic-algorithm-playground.git
   cd rust-genetic-algorithm-playground
   ```
2. Build and run any project:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin project_name
   ```
   Replace `project_name` with the specific project you want to run (e.g., `procedural_world_generator`).

## 🌱 Future Additions

- **Interactive Evolutionary Art Generator:** Combine genetic algorithms with aesthetics to generate evolving visual art.
- **Neural Network Optimizer:** Use genetic algorithms to optimize simple neural networks.
- **Ecosystem Simulator:** A dynamic world where creatures interact, reproduce, and evolve over time.
